Read this carefully with responsiblility:

we will first analyze the docs of this project to understan what we are going to build, the we read the whole and entire codebase of the past ptojects and other project, copy important things that matter, to create first mind map that hepl us to decide what we'll use in this hackathone, and then hepl us in creation of constitution

Read this projest docs: @Doc-Personal-AI-Employee-Hackathon-0_ Building-Autonomous-FTEs-in-2026

Personal AI Employee Hackathon 0 Building Autonomous FTEs (Full-Time Equivalent) in 2026


Read this projest Rough planning: @Personal-AI-Employee-Hackathon-0-Rough Planning
extraced data from experienced teachers prject show-casing 
we learn form there mistakes and use best ideas and approach and techstacks, that they use  

then read and copy

from these two  directions:
e:\M.Y\GIAIC-Hackathons\Evolution-of-Todo
e:\M.Y\GIAIC-Hackathons\final-project-v2\Humanoid-Robots-Book 


read the entire, scripts,all main and sub folders and files, all *.md files including readme.md, agent.md, claude.md, swarm and spawn agent-team, workflows, automatons, histories, prompts, tests, reviews, feedback, flaws, failures, success, all specs, allspec.md, all clarify.md, all plan.md, all adr.md, all task.md, all implement.md all analyze.md, all checklist.md, all reports all research and generals, read rules, laws, governanve, ai control folder   
each entire and everythings


copy, scripts, workflow, automations, governance, rules, law, loops, that will required in this project



from these directoried read, understand and copy my prompts:

E:\M.Y\GIAIC-Hackathons\Personal-AI-Employee-Hackathon-0\How-I-give-prompts

  read @prompt-01 
       1st prompt file and understand how i give prompt to gemini and chatgpt        to generate project related prompt that i that i then give to claude,             fot its understanding what input and output i want


  read @prompt-2
      2nd prompt file and understand how i give prompt to claude, fot its       understanding what input and output i want


  read @resume-prompt
     3rd prompt file and understand how i give prompt to claude, every next day to 
     resume and continue where we left



  read @You've-hit-your-limit-·reset
     4th prompt file and understand how i give prompt to claude, after limit reset 


and read other file like claude-dot-md and phase 3- bot- test 


to automate my repeating patterns, mistakes, loops, we can generate reusable intelligence, skills, subagents, add MCPs, create scripts, workflows, automations, secure, validate, handle erros and debug deep dive  root and atomic cuse as much as tests Driven entirly (backend, frontend, at ui for actul user experince on browser), review and feedbak, and deliver perfectly with client and user setifaction  
and can create setup like step back, reverce and think out of the box, and elephant in the room  you cna tell me what mistakes im am doing, i will tell you yours, how should do  here , what should, and where should do, an waht to do here, you and I will teach and guide each other during the execution to avoid again and reset the problem at a time 


so that we can create our this time governance, control and imperator will more deep and strong tough, and not miss any place
and everything become more transparent 



and then we satrt our work, prepate structure, creat constitution for H0  and guides to fulfill and success the project delivery


set multiple claude instance at perfect and different positions for different works parallelly and take full benefits of it
