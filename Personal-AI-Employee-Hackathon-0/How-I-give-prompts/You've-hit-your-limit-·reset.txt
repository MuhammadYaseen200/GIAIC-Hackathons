when limit reset, first we do that:




create an agent team spawn teammates, and coordinate work, new update feature with opus 4.6, 

Browse the todo app we created now, completely E2E test all features, endpoints, connections, Chatkit, natural language conversation, and task with chatbot, responsing,
  Auth, Neondb, full CRUDs operation,
  If any api key, Url, Connecion missing tell me and i will provide you,
  properly flully and deeply verify,

  Utilize all new applied enforcement, governence, rules, laws, redulations, loops, automations, workflows

  if found bug and error or if work in wrong directory instead of E:\M.Y\GIAIC-Hackathons\Evolution-of-Todo, stop and
  get the correct directory and then continue,
  Wrong Directory = no work, stop imediately, or get right directory move everything related to project in correct
  directory


 use Specialized, sub-agents, Skills, MCPs, Plugins and Hooks  that must be used during this major development, either orchestrate,
  run in parallel, or one by one but must use them without any of them don't go further stop the work and tell what
  the problem is occuring and how to fix

example agent-team work flow:

 - Display modes: Default is "in-process" (all in one terminal). Use Shift+Up/Down to navigate between teammates.
  Split-pane mode requires tmux or iTerm2.
  - Delegate mode: Press Shift+Tab to restrict the lead to coordination-only (no coding itself).
  - Token cost: Significantly higher than single sessions since each teammate has its own context window.
  - Limitations on Windows: Split-pane mode isn't supported in Windows Terminal — you'll use in-process mode.
  - No session resumption: /resume and /rewind won't restore in-process teammates.
